For this week's lab, we will be revisiting questions from previous lab
assignments, with the purpose of using functions from the `map()` family to 
iterate over certain tasks. To do this, we will need to load in the data from 
Lab 2, Lab 3, and Lab 7. I've included **all** three datasets in the `data`
folder, so all you need to do is read them in. 🙃 

```{r}
#| label: read-in-old-data

# Data from Lab 2
surveys <- read_csv(here::here("data", "surveys.csv"))

# Data from Lab 3
evals <- read_csv(here::here("data", "teacher_evals.csv")) |> 
  rename(sex = gender)

# Data from Lab 7
fish <- read_csv(here::here("data", "BlackfootFish.csv"))
```

## Lab 2

First up, we're going to revisit Question 3 from Lab 2. This question asked:

> What are the data types of the variables in this dataset?

**1. Using `map_chr()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the data type of each variable in the `surveys` dataset.** Specifically, the table should have 15 columns, one for
each variable, with the datatype of that variable immediately below it's name.

```{r}
#| label: map-data-types-of-surveys

surveys_types <- map_chr(surveys, ~ class(.x))

kable(data.frame(
  data_type = surveys_types), 
  col.names = c("Variable Name", "Data Type"),
  align = "c")

```

## Lab 3

Now, were on to Lab 3 where we will revisit two questions. 

In the original version of Lab 3, Question 5 asked you to:

> Change data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID
> really a numeric data type?)

**2. Using `map_at()`, convert the `teacher_id`, `weekday`, `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `gender` columns to factors.** Hint: You will need to use `bind_cols()` to transform the 
list output back into a data frame. 

```{r}
#| label: map-to-mutate-columns

result <- surveys |>
  map_at(.at = c("teacher_id",
                 "weekday",
                 "academic_degree",
                 "seniority",
                 "gender"),
         .f = as.character) |>
  bind_cols()

kable(result[1:20, ], col.names = gsub("[_]", " ", names(result)), 
      align = "c") |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 14, 
                            position = "center")

```

)
Next up, we're going revisit Question 7 which asked:
> What are the demographics of the instructors in this study? Investigate the
> variables `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `sex` and summarize your
> findings in ~3 complete sentences.

Many people created **multiple** tables of counts for each of these
demographics, but in this exercise we are going to create **one** table with 
every demographic.

**3. Using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, recreate the table below.**

I'm using the `sen_level` classification from Challenge 3

- `"junior"` = `seniority` is 4 or less (inclusive)
- `"senior"` = `seniority` is more than 4

```{r}
#| label: double-pivot-for-summary-table

demographics <- function(data) {
  degree_dem <- data |> 
    distinct(teacher_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
    count(academic_degree) |> 
    rename(count_academic_degree = n)
  
  seniority_dem <- data |> 
    distinct(teacher_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
    count(seniority) |>
    rename(count_seniority = n)

    distinct(teacher_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |>

    rename(count_sex = n)
  
combined_counts <- bind_rows(
    degree_dem,
    seniority_dem,
    sex_dem
  )
  
  return(combined_counts)
}

evals_demographics <- demographics(evals)


evals_demographics <- evals_demographics |>
  mutate(
    seniority_group = case_when(
      seniority <= 4 ~ "Junior (4 years or less)",
      seniority > 4 ~ "Senior (more than 4 years)"
    )
  )
  
long_data <- evals_demographics |>

    cols = c(count_academic_degree, count_seniority, count_sex),

  select(
    academic_degree,
    sex,
    seniority_group,
    count_value
  ) |>
  group_by(academic_degree, sex, seniority_group) |>
  summarise(total_count_value = sum(count_value, na.rm = TRUE))

wide_data <- long_data |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(academic_degree, sex, seniority_group),
    values_from = total_count_value
  ) |>
  select(
    "Female" = 'NA_female_NA',
    "Male" = 'NA_male_NA',
    "Junior (4 years or less)" = 'NA_NA_Junior (4 years or less)',
    "Senior (more than 4 years)" = 'NA_NA_Senior (more than 4 years)',
    "No Degree" = 'no_dgr_NA_NA',
    "Masters" = 'ma_NA_NA',
    "Doctorate" = 'dr_NA_NA',
    "Professor" = 'prof_NA_NA',
  ) 

kable(wide_data, align = "l")
```


::: {.callout-tip}
If you are interested in exploring my table fomatting, I specifically used the 
`kable()` function from the **knitr** package to first get an HTML table. Then
I styled that table using the `kable_styling()` function from the **kableExtra**
package.

## Lab 7

For our last problem, we will revisit a question from the most recent lab. 
Question 1 asked you to use `across()` to make a table which summarized: 

> What variable(s) have missing values present?  
> How many observations have missing values?

**4. Using `map_int()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the number of missing values for each variable in the `fish` data.** 

```{r}
#| label: map-missing-values-of-fish

missing_values <- fish |>
  map_int(~ sum(is.na(.)))

kable(missing_values,
      col.names = c("Variable", "Number of Missing Values"),
      align = "c")
```
